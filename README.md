# Travel Planner App
Project "Travel Planner App Project" for Udacity's Frontend Developer nanodegree program.

## Description
Travel Planner App is an asynchronous web app that allows users to enter the destination and
the travelling dates for their next trip. The app will then return the weather forecast of 
the set date and destination, plus an image of the place the user is travelling to.

The Geonames API retrieves the latitude and longitude of the entered location, and sends the
info to the Dark Sky API to get the weather forecast. 

## How to Run
Compile the files and start the server by running in the terminal:
```
npm run build
```
```
npm run start
```
